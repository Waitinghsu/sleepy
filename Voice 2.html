<p>Bod had never thought of that one day he would leave the graveyard and leave his family before Scarlett said these words. Although Bob told Scarlett that it is dangerous outsides for him, it still made him be curious about the world outside the graveyard. The reason why Scarlett be silent at last is that she thought it would be very regrettable for Bod to stay in the graveyard in his whole life. In Scarlettâ€™s opinion, many things in this world are worthy to explore by themselves. Therefore, I think she felt sorry about that Bob cannot have an opportunity to see the different world.</p>
