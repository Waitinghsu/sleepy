<h1>Voice 3</h1>
<p>I think the graveyard in Bob’s mind is just like the comfort zone we always talk about. In the past, I am often afraid of trying new things and standing in front of people to talk. However, when I was in college, I realized that if I don’t have the courage to step out of my comfort zone, I would not know what I really want to do. Therefore, I signed up the educational program for English teaching last summer vacation. Most of the curriculums need to have the teaching demonstration. I was still very nervous before I got on the stage even though I practiced a lot at home. However, I overcame my fear and finished every teaching demonstration. I was very happy and know that once I try, it doesn't matter even if I failed. Stepping out of my comfort zone may face some difficulties, but I would get experience.</p>
