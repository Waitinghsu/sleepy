	<p style="font-size:100%">“Well, you can’t stay here all your life. Can you? One day you’ll grow up and then you will have to go and live in the world outside.”</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">He shook his head. “It’s not safe for me out there.”</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">“Who says?”</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">“Silas. My family. Everybody.”</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">She was silent.</p>

	<p style="font-size:100%">Bod had never thought of that one day he would leave the graveyard and leave his family before Scarlett said these words. 
	<p style="font-size:100%">Although Bob told Scarlett that it is dangerous outsides for him, it still made him be curious about the world outside the graveyard.</p> 
	<p style="font-size:100%">The reason why Scarlett be silent at last is that she thought it would be very regrettable for Bod to stay in the graveyard in his whole life.</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">In Scarlett’s opinion, many things in this world are worthy to explore by themselves. Therefore, I think she felt sorry about that Bob cannot have an opportunity to see the different world.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size:200%; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Voice 3</h1>
	<p style="font-size:100%">I think the graveyard in Bob’s mind is just like the comfort zone we always talk about. In the past, I am often afraid of trying new things and standing in front of people to talk.</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">However, when I was in college, I realized that if I don’t have the courage to step out of my comfort zone, I would not know what I really want to do.</p> 
	<p style="font-size:100%">Therefore, I signed up the educational program for English teaching last summer vacation. Most of the curriculums need to have the teaching demonstration. I was still very nervous before I got on the stage even though I practiced a lot at home.</p>
	<p style="font-size:100%">However, I overcame my fear and finished every teaching demonstration. I was very happy and know that once I try, it doesn't matter even if I failed. Stepping out of my comfort zone may face some difficulties, but I would get experience.</p>
