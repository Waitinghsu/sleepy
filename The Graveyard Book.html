<h1>Voice 1</h1>
<p>“Well, you can’t stay here all your life. Can you? One day you’ll grow up and then you will have to go and live in the world outside.”
He shook his head. “It’s not safe for me out there.”
“Who says?”
“Silas. My family. Everybody.”
She was silent.</p>
<br>
<h1>Voice 2</h1>
<p>Bod had never thought of that one day he would leave the graveyard and leave his family before Scarlett said these words. Although Bob told Scarlett that it is dangerous outsides for him, it still made him be curious about the world outside the graveyard. The reason why Scarlett be silent at last is that she thought it would be very regrettable for Bod to stay in the graveyard in his whole life. In Scarlett’s opinion, many things in this world are worthy to explore by themselves. Therefore, I think she felt sorry about that Bob cannot have an opportunity to see the different world.</p>
<br>
<h1>Voice 3</h1>
<p>I think the graveyard in Bob’s mind is just like the comfort zone we always talk about. In the past, I am often afraid of trying new things and standing in front of people to talk. However, when I was in college, I realized that if I don’t have the courage to step out of my comfort zone, I would not know what I really want to do. Therefore, I signed up the educational program for English teaching last summer vacation. Most of the curriculums need to have the teaching demonstration. I was still very nervous before I got on the stage even though I practiced a lot at home. However, I overcame my fear and finished every teaching demonstration. I was very happy and know that once I try, it doesn't matter even if I failed. Stepping out of my comfort zone may face some difficulties, but I would get experience.</p>
